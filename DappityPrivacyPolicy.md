# Dappity Privacy Policy

## Dappity respects the privacy of our users
Dappity respects the privacy and digital rights of our users. 

We do not collect customer personal information or any customer data.

 We do not disclose customer personal information or any customer data to third parties for any purpose.

In compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act, Dappity has a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure.

## How does Dappity recall apps I’ve previously used?
A key feature of Dappity is recalling apps previously used by the customer.

The data about previously used Blockstack apps is not collected by Dappity but is retained on the Blockstack* authentication.

Dappity uses Blockstack Id authentication for log in.

When a Blockstack user logs into a Blockstack app, that data is retained at the Blockstack authentication layer.

Only multiplayer apps (apps that allow data sharing) have access to data retained on the Blockstack authentication.

*Blockstack refers to Blockstack PBC. For more information about Blockstack and the  Blockstack PBC privacy policy, please visit the Blockstack site: https://blockstack.org/legal/privacy-policy*

## Sections

### Your California Privacy Rights (As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)
A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom they have established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. 

In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. 

However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure. The business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of their right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
